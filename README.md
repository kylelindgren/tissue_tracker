MSEE Thesis work at University of Washington BioRobotics Lab

The main goal of this tissue tracking work is to track a deformable region 
of interest during a surgical operation to provide visual and robotic end effector 
stabilization in realtime. This code contains motion and deformation tracking for 
visual stabilization, with end effector stabilization and realtime implementation 
the subject of future work.
